# JavaScript Learning Repository

This folder contains various JavaScript files demonstrating different concepts, features, and functionalities of the JavaScript programming language. Below is a brief description of the files:

## Files Overview

1. **comp.js**  
   Demonstrates comparison operators, including loose (`==`) and strict (`===`) equality, and comparisons involving `null`.

2. **scope.js**  
   Explores variable scoping using `var`, `let`, and `const`, along with function and block scopes.

3. **number.js**  
   Covers number-related operations, including `Math` functions, random number generation, and date manipulation.

4. **loop.js**  
   Contains examples of loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`), iterating over arrays, objects, and maps, and using higher-order functions like `forEach`, `map`, and `reduce`.

5. **index.js**  
   Introduces basic JavaScript concepts, including variable declarations (`var`, `let`, `const`) and console output.

6. **function.js**  
   Demonstrates function declarations, default parameters, rest parameters, and higher-order functions.

7. **array.js**  
   Explores array operations, including `push`, `pop`, `slice`, `splice`, and the use of spread operators.

8. **datatypes.js**  
   Discusses JavaScript data types, type conversions, and the behavior of `NaN`.

9. **iife.js**  
   Demonstrates Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and their usage.

10. **object.js**  
    Covers object creation, nested objects, `Object.assign`, and destructuring.

11. **string.js**  
    Explores string operations, including slicing, replacing, and converting to uppercase.

12. **arrow.js**  
    Demonstrates arrow functions, their syntax, and behavior with the `this` keyword.

13. **promise.js**  
    Introduces the concept of Promises in JavaScript, including examples of `Promise.resolve`, `Promise.reject`, `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, and chaining `.then`, `.catch`, and `.finally`.

14. **promiseApi.js**  
    Demonstrates advanced Promise APIs such as `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`, `Promise.race`, and `Promise.any`. Includes examples of handling multiple asynchronous operations with different outcomes (resolved or rejected).

15. **async.js**  
    Explores asynchronous programming using `async`/`await` syntax. Includes examples of handling Promises with `await`, chaining asynchronous operations, and combining `async` functions with traditional Promise handling.

## How to Use

- Open any file to explore the specific JavaScript concept it demonstrates.
- Modify or run the code snippets to deepen your understanding of JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of JavaScript.
- A code editor like Visual Studio Code.
- Node.js installed (optional, for running JavaScript files outside the browser).

Happy Learning!
